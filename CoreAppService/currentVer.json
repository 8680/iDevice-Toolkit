    "This is a BIG update!",
    "You can now inject real iOS Jailbreak tweaks (DYLIB / Framework) into IPA applications. Just specify the IPA file and the tweak, and the tool will combine them and give you an IPA you can either sign with AltStore / Sideloadly / ESIGN, etc., or install via TrollStore (where available). This module works on iOS 16.0 - iOS 18.5 on all devices. Use responsibly. iDevice Central never has and never will condone piracy!",
    "Fixed some UI bugs."
