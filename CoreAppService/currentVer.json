    "This is a BIG update!",
    "There is now a File Manager in the app. You can access it via the folder icon in the top-right corner near the terminal. It can browse the paths available in jailed mode (/System, /Developer, etc.), it can play audio files (good for tweak development so you can disable sounds, etc.)",
    "The Terminal now includes a Dismiss Terminal button at the bottom to close it more easily.",
    "Fixed some extra bugs."
